## Project Summary

Our ambitious plan for this 2 week project was to create a robust tool that allowed players to create, track, and maintain characters & campaigns in an online database. We wanted to put online many of the offline elements of D&D. Things like character creation, stat tracking, equipment tracking, campaign notes, campaign progress, and DM campaign variables are typically maintained with pen and paper. This tool, if fully realized, could help create an online database to track, analyze, and crowd-source aggregate player data. This data could be used to make the game as paperless as possible. It could also help users see what kind of classes, spells, and tactics are commonly used or most effective for any given campaign. In essence, this tool could help form a metagame for a game-space that typically does not engage in metagames. We had some big goals for this project and we hope you enjoy what we built! 

## Usage

### Login/Signup

You will be greeted by a login/signup page. You know what to do!

### Main Menu

From there, you will see the main menu page. Your first step will likely be to create a new character!
<img src="https://github.com/Dungeons-Developers/DnD-React/blob/development/assets/mainmenu.png">

### Character Create

You can fill out the character creation form to build your new adventurer!

Be careful when assigning ability scores as there are no takesie-backsies!

### View Characters

Once you have created a character, you will be returned to the Character Select screen. From there you can create another character or view/edit one of your existing characters. Character avatar images are randomly generated by a query of your character's class to <a href="https://unsplash.com">Unsplash's image API</a>.

### Character Select/Edit

If you view your character's details, you can see all their relevant stats and equipment. 
<img src="https://github.com/Dungeons-Developers/DnD-React/blob/development/assets/characterdetails.png">

You can also select the Edit tab to edit some of your characters attributes/equipment.

### Create Campaign

The next thing you will want to do is create a campaign! Use the navbar at the top, or the card on the main menu, to select this option. Once there, you will see a form you can complete with details of your campaign.
<img src="https://github.com/Dungeons-Developers/DnD-React/blob/development/assets/campaigncreate.png">

After you create your campaign, you will see a screen like this. You can use your unique campaign ID to have your friends join your campaign! You can also add one of your characters to the campaign if you wish to participate as well.

### Join Campaign

To join a campaign, input the appropriate campaign ID string into the CampaignID field like so.
<img src="https://github.com/Dungeons-Developers/DnD-React/blob/development/assets/campaignjoin.png">

Now all you need to do is wait for your friends to join your campaign! You will see their character cards when they enter your room. And you can click on the Character Details link to view their attributes. If you are the DM, then you will have the ability to edit some of their attributes. You will also notice on the right that each character can roll dice and these rolls are visible to everybody in the party! That way you can keep things honest.

Enjoy questing with your party!

### 1. User Login 
**User Story:**
As a user, I want to be able to create an account such that my user data is only accessible to me.

**Feature Tasks:**
* Create data structure for the player object
* User login will require username, password, and email (for campaign invite reasons?)
* Build a user flow to navigate the user through account creation and account login
* Save all this info into an object tied to the user account

**Acceptance Tests:**
* Ensure that the user object is well-structured and scalable
* Ensure that the instructions for iterating through account creation are simple and easy to understand

## Team Agreement

**Communication plan:** 
How will your group communicate with each other? What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voices are heard, and that contributions from both loud and soft voices are listened to? Do you have a plan for managing psychological safety?

Slack will be our primary channel for communication. We will be sure to have each member contribute to all discussions, assuming they feel they have something to say. Nothing is required.
In the event of psychological safety issues, concerned members should reach out to a 3rd party within the group to mediate. If that is not amenable or if that fails to mitigate the issue, the concerned members will reach out to Sonia or CF admins to escalate the issue.

**Conflict plan:** What will your group do when it encounters conflict? What will your process be to resolve it?
Should a conflict arise, we will discuss it as a group. We can either vote or refer to the lead for that scope to break ties. If the conflict is personal, we will revert to the guidelines outlined in our Communication Plan. 

**Work plan:** How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general? In particular, make sure you know how you’ll track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the application, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. What project management tool will be used?

We will use Github Projects for task management. We will aim to balance the number of commits equally across the team. We may or may not assign a Project Manager role to the team (Daniel volunteers).

**Git process:** What is your Git flow? How many people must review a PR? Who merges PRs? How often will you merge? How will you communicate that it’s time to merge?

`Master > Dev > Feature`

Feature merges into Dev branch will require one other team member to approve. Merges from dev into master will require every member of the team to approve, pending a code review.

Merge communication will happen via Slack, or over comms via Remo.

**Anything else you feel is important:** Expectations around work times, stand-up times(outside of the ones schedule with the instructional team), taking breaks/seeking help when you’re stuck, etc.

Regarding working windows, we will stick to class hours (6:30 to 9:30pm, M-Th) as a bare minimum. If folks want to start earlier or work later, that is totally okay too!

## Origin Story

We are all huge fans of the Dungeons & Dragons universe and the many, many fantasy worlds it has inspired. Building out some kind of D&D-focused application has been a goal for us ever since we started taking classes at Code Fellows. We are also tryhard gamers and wanted to incorporate some kind of shared tracking system into a gaming space that was traditionally managed with paper and pencil. We are hoping that our application can illustrate how making it easy to share, manipulate, and analyze D&D aggregate data could help create a digital online metagame for an analog gamespace.
